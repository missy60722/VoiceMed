  "q1":"Q1: Can medications be taken with milk or juice?",
  "a1":"A1: Many medications can interact with milk or grapefruit juice:\n\n1.Tetracyclines and quinolone antibiotics should not be taken with milk, calcium supplements, or products containing calcium, magnesium, or other minerals (like dairy, mineral drinks, or multivitamins). These minerals can bind with the medication, reducing absorption and effectiveness. It is recommended to take these medications on an empty stomach or at least two hours apart from such products.\n2.Grapefruit juice can inhibit drug metabolism in the small intestine, increasing the risk of toxicity,  especially with medications like sedatives, tranquilizers, and calcium channel blockers.\n\nIf you are unsure whether your medication interacts with milk or juice, or cannot avoid these combinations, consult your doctor or pharmacist. For safer use, it's best to take medications with plain water instead of other beverages.",
  "q2":"Q2: What should be noted when taking medication?",

Leave a 2-hour gap between taking Western and traditional Chinese medicines.\n6.If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.
